Features

Click on a movie to view detailed information such as title, runtime, showtime, available tickets, description, and poster.

Technologies Used

CSS (Minimal styling)
JavaScript (ES6)

Usage
Upon opening the web application, you will see a list of movies.
Click on any movie title to view its details including runtime, showtime, description, and available tickets.
Use the "Buy Ticket" button to purchase tickets. The available ticket count will decrease accordingly.
Once all tickets are sold out for a movie, the "Buy Ticket" button will be disabled and show "SOLD OUT".
